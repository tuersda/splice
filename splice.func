#This function was written by Douglas Tuers
#8/28/2019
#added second argument and error handling on 9/6/2019
#This function takes as an argument a string 
#it then splits the string up into a vector consisting 
#of each character in the string
#the first argument in the string we are splicing
#the second argument indexes a character in the string
#
#this is a new line
#this is a newer line
#this is an even newer line
#this is even newer than the last line
#
#things to do: can we pass a file to the function? can we
#have the user enter a string if none is given
#can we also make so that we index words seperated by white
#space tab comma etc an then pick out a letter in that word. 
#say the third letter in the 43 word
